Introduction                                          *local-vimrc-introduction*

LocalVimrc is used to provide fine grained vimrc control. Let's say you're
contributing to multiple projects with different coding conventions (e.g. tab
width), it's hard to have a single vimrc serving all the requirements.

'modeline' may work in some cases, but it's tedious to add specialized config
to all files in a project. What you want is per-project or even per-directory
configuration.

LocalVimrc provide this functionality by loading all qualified vimrc on the
path to the file while you open it in a buffer. Hence you may put your config
under project root to have it applied to all the files under the project. You
may even put another config under a directory to override configs for that
directory only.


==============================================================================
Usage                                                        *local-vimrc-usage*

To have a local vimrc (lvimrc) for a project, use vim to create/edit a vim
script name `.lvimrc` under project root.
>
        $ vim "$PROJ_ROOT"/.lvimrc
<
Upon save, our plugin will automatically compute and append a checksum to your
lvimrc, which will then make it a valid lvimrc. Check |local-vimrc-validation|
for further details.

In fact, any file with its name ends with `lvimrc` would be recognized by our
plugin. Hence you may have multiple lvimrc under a directory. E.g.

* lvimrc
* .lvimrc
* another.lvimrc
* .another.hidden.lvimrc
* abcdefglvimrc


==============================================================================
Validation                                              *local-vimrc-validation*

To prevent executing malicious vim script that's NOT written by the user, our
plugin will try to validate lvimrc before loading its content.

Any valid lvimrc should ends with a line containing the checksum of the file.
>
        " local-vimrc-digest: <CHECKSUM>
<
The checksum is calculated as the HMAC value of the content with a key locally
generated. Hence the same script would have different checksums on different
machine (or user, since it's a per-user key).

To make things easier, the checksum will be updated whenever the user try to
save a file with qualified file name. As a result, the mechanism should not
cause any problem for normal use cases.
